# Hi, I'm Anthony! Welcome to my Phase-1 project! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a student at Flatiron School currently completing the Phase-1 assessment Project. Currently in the process of transitioning careers from Chemical Engineering to Software Engineering. I am currently working at JPMC and look forward to moving up within the company and become a software engineer. This is one of many projects I will be adding to my portfolio once I graduate from the program. 


# Digital Art Museum Project



Welcome to my phase 1 assessment project. As part of the Flatiron School program, each phase contains a project that is required to complete before moving on to the next phase. This project will include various topics and code I have learned throughout the past few weeks at Flatiron School. This project contains one HTML, one JS, and one CSS, and one README file. My webpage will display art images that span across centuries. It is a simple webpage that allows users to input two pieces of information. The first input box requires the user to type in a keyword; this can be a specific painting or any keyword. The API used in this project has a search-endpoint, meaning the API fetch method is based on what the user inputs in the search box. The second box requires the user to input a number less than or equal to 100. This allows the webpage to load the desired number of images the user wants to display.  

## Features

- Dynamically displays 1-100 art images from API source
- Like button displays a thank you message from the author
- Submit button changes color during mouse-over
- If number input is >100, pop-up message displays
- Colorful rainbow text animation loop
