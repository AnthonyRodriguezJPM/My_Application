My Phase 1 App! Let's get started!!

This application is my Phase 1 assessment project. It will include various topics and code I have learned throughout the past few weeks at Flatiron School. 

I will use an Art API from the Art Institute of Chicago. This API is very interactive and had endpoints from ID, search, or pagination. I will display the first 10 images from a search and display relevant information about those art pieces.
