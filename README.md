Welcome to my My Phase 1 Project! 

# Project Title

Digital Art Musuem Project

Welcome to my phase 1 assessment project. As part of the Flatiron School program, each phase contains a project that is required to complete before moving on to phase 2. It will include various topics and code I have learned throughout the past few weeks at Flatiron School. This project contains a one HTML, one JS, and one CSS file, and will display art images that spans across centuries. It is a simple webpage that allows users to input two pieces of information. The first input box requires the user to type in a keyword; this can be a specific painting or any keyword. The API used has a search-endpoint, meaning the API fetch method is based on what the user inputs in the search box. The second box requires the user to input a number less than or equal to 100. This allows the webpage to load the desired number of images the user wants to display.

This application is my Phase 1 assessment project. 

I will use an Art API from the Art Institute of Chicago. This API is very interactive and had endpoints from ID, search, or pagination. I will display the first 10 images from a search and display relevant information about those art pieces. 

This project involves a webpage created with the help of the Art Institute of Chicago public API.
